# News-Article-Sorting

The goal of this NLP project is to develop a system that can automatically sort and categorize articles based on their content. The system will use natural 
language processing techniques to analyze the text of each article and determine its topic, subtopic, and other relevant characteristics.

The system will be designed to handle a large volume of articles, and it will be able to adapt to new topics and categories as they emerge. 
The system will use a combination of machine learning algorithms and rule-based approaches to identify key features and patterns in the text, and then assign each 
article to the appropriate category.

Overall, this article sorting NLP project has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of content curation and knowledge
management for media organizations, research institutions, and other organizations that rely on large volumes
of written content.
